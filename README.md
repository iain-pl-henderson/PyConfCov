These files can be used to reproduce the numerical experiments described in the preprint "Adaptive inference with random ellipsoids through Conformal Conditional Linear Expectation" (2024) available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18508 .

To reproduce the experiments, run the script test.py. This script is organised as follow.

Beware that the parameters that correspond to the experiments described in the paper correspond to time-consuming experiments.

- a first part where the parameters of the numerical experiments are set.
